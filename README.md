## How to run?
You can launch application for example in different three ways:
- Download executable file .exe from [releases-windows](https://github.com/plkpiotr/Christmas-Tree/releases/tag/windows) [option for Windows] and then set convenient size font's and size console's [I recommend Window Size 47x60 for Consolas Bold 14]
- Download Makefile with source code from [releases-linux](https://github.com/plkpiotr/Christmas-Tree/releases/tag/linux) [option for Linux] and then enter into terminal:
  ```sh
  make

Condition of correct display is setting monospaced font in the terminal and text file after exporting.
